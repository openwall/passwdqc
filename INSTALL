Many Linux distributions, FreeBSD 5.0+, and DragonFly BSD 2.2+ include
pam_passwdqc or the full-blown passwdqc package in the distribution or
provide it as a "native" package to be installed - so you may just use
that.  The instructions below apply if your distribution lacks passwdqc
or if you prefer to build and install passwdqc on your own (such as to
get a newer version of it than one available in/for the distribution).

On a system with the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) framework,
you may build all components of passwdqc (the library, the PAM module,
and two command-line programs) by simply running "make".  To install,
run "make install".  To uninstall, run "make uninstall".

On a system with the PAM framework built with i18n support enabled
you may also build pam_passwdqc with i18n support by adding
-DENABLE_NLS=1 to CPPFLAGS.  To compile translation files, run
"make locales".  To install them, run "make install_locales".

On a system with the PAM framework built with Linux audit support
enabled you may also build pam_passwdqc with audit support by adding
-DHAVE_LIBAUDIT=1 to CPPFLAGS.

On a system without PAM, you may build everything but the PAM module
with "make utils".  To install, run "make install_lib install_utils".
To uninstall, run "make remove_lib remove_utils".

Please note that currently passwdqc's default is to install right into
system directories such as /etc, /lib, /usr/lib, /usr/include,
/usr/share/man, /usr/bin.  If desired, these pathnames may be overridden
on make's command-line (please see Makefile for the available macro
names and passwdqc.spec for some examples).

Since passwdqc installs a new shared library, you may need to run the
ldconfig(8) program to update the dynamic linker cache.

Alternatively, on a Red Hat'ish Linux system and under an account
configured to build RPM packages (perhaps with ~/.rpmmacros specifying
the proper pathnames for %_topdir, %_tmppath, and %buildroot), you may
build RPM packages by running "rpmbuild -tb passwdqc-2.0.3.tar.gz", then
install the two binary subpackages with "rpm -Uvh passwdqc*-2.0.3*.rpm".
This works due to the RPM spec file included in the tarball.

Please refer to README and PLATFORMS for information on configuring your
system to use the PAM module.  You may also refer to the pam_passwdqc(8)
and passwdqc.conf(5) manual pages.

Please refer to the pwqcheck(1), pwqfilter(1), and pwqgen(1) manual
pages for information on using the command-line programs.
